Given an array A of size N of integers. Your task is to find the sum of minimum and maximum element in the array.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {-2, 1, -4, 5, 3}
Output: 1
Explanation: min = -4, max =  5. Sum = -4 + 5 = 1
Example 2:
Input:
N = 4
A[]  = {1, 3, 4, 1}
Output: 5
Explanation: min = 1, max = 4. Sum = 1 + 4 = 5
Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findSum() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and returns the summation of minimum and maximum element of the array.
Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution:
    def findSum(self, A, N):
        if not A:
            return "Array is empty"

        # Initialize min_value to positive infinity and max_value to negative infinity
        min_value = float('inf')
        max_value = float('-inf')

        # Iterate through the array to find min and max values
        for num in A:
            if num < min_value:
                min_value = num
            if num > max_value:
                max_value = num

        # Calculate and return the sum of min and max values
        result_sum = min_value + max_value
        return result_sum
