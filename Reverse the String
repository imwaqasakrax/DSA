Problem statement
You are given a string 'STR'. The string contains [a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] [special characters]. You have to find the reverse of the string.
For example:
If the given string is: STR = "abcde". You have to print the string "edcba".

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 10
1 ≤ |STR| ≤ 10 ^ 5 
Where |STR| is the length of the string STR.
Time limit: 1 sec.
Sample Input 1:
3
abcde
coding
hello1
Sample Output 1:
edcba
gnidoc
1olleh
Explanation of the Sample Input 1:
For the first test case, STR = "abcde". We need to reverse the string, that is the first element becomes the last element and the last element becomes the first element, the second element becomes the second last element and the second last element becomes the second element and so on. So we get, "edcba".
Sample Input 2:
3
a
1det@Z
$1xYuP
Sample Output 2
a
Z@ted1
PuYx1$
